Arduino-based Point-of-sales system 

I made a point-of-sales system using Arduino, a receipt printer, a 20x4 LCD and a keyboard
 on October 13, 2012. I thought it would be a good exercise for me because I really wanted
 a reason to use the Adafruit receipt printer and I would have an example of an embedded 
 systems project that was complicated enough to require a state machine. I've documented 
 all the hardware and software at:
